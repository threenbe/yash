# yash

A shell that I wrote in C for my OS class in undergrad. It was called a "yash" shell. Don't remember the exact specifications, but they were limited in their scope so as to not be overly difficult for us. Might be able to dig them up so I can populate this README with something a bit more meaningful.

While I aced the project in class, I remember feeling like I didn't do a particularly good job. And yet I feel like a much smarter person than present-day me must've written this code. Guess that's what stagnation feels like. 

I'd like to write a better shell someday. That'll show past-me.
